        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love to travel, specfically in search of some of the best beaches in the world.
          So far my favourite country to visit has been Greece. I’ve always loved drawing from
          a very young age and taking photos, many of which I’ve included here. I started this
          program just after finishing secondary school, I haven’t gotten all the experiences
          I’ve wanted because of Covid. Although, I’m very happy to be here now, however I’m
          sure my dog Luna who is still stuck at home isn’t as excited.</p>
